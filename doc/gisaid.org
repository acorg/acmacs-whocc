** Click Download
** Format: Sequences (DNA) as FASTA (second radio button)
** DNA: HA (checkbox to the left from HA)
** FASTA Header: Isolate name |  Collection date | Passage details/history |  Sample ID by submitting lab | Submitting lab | Type |  Lineage

** Check for incorrect duplicates and perhaps fix them
ad gisaid-fasta-merge /d/gisaid_epiflu_sequence.fasta >/dev/null
** Install file: ~/AD/sources/ssm-report/bin/gisaid-fasta-install (just run it without arguments)
** make seqdb from newly downloaded fasta file only just to check file content and hidb matching
